Sample application to demonstrate Multi-module Clean MVVM Architecture and usage of Kotlin Flow, ConstraintLayout, Android Hilt, Data-Binding, Navigation Graph etc.

Clean architecture means the overall design of the project. It’s the organization of the code into classes or files or components or modules. And it’s how all these groups of code relate to each other. The architecture defines where the application performs its core functionality and how that functionality interacts with things like user interface.

**Overview**


- Material Design & ConstraintLayout
* View Binding & Data binding
+ Coroutines & Kotlin Flow
- Android Hilt - for Dependency Injection
* Multi module Clean MVVM Architecture (For smooth scalability)
+ Navigation Graph - NavController for Fragment transitions
- Unit testing - with Mockito & JUnit
* Retrofit - for Network Requests
+ Clean Architecture
